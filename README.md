# iOS App Nanodegree: OnTheMap

Repo for submitting OnTheMap, a networked app that queries Udacity's mock API for student locations around the world. Additionally, users can authenticate and add their own locations as well, which are then dynamically added to the map following a successful POST to the server..

The code was developed on Xcode 11 and tested on iPhone SE.
